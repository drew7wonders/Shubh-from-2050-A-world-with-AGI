Shubh From 2050: A world with AGI
Hello, I'm Shubh. It's 05 Nov 2050, nothing new just like any other regular day, by the way, I'm 40 years old and right now I'm going to get my anti-aging shots, no wonder I look like 20 and can still run like a sprinter. I also have to get my blood reports I have a cold, I remember how we use to wait for a day to get our lab report, but not any more there's a machine in the doctor's cabin where he puts the blood and within a second it gives out the report, yeah the file guy is lazy and takes 5 min to file a 3-page report, but still better than a day for a report. Now I don't wanna brag, but we have found a way to cure any type of cancer in just a week of treatment. And we haven't had any food crisis in like 2-3 decades, because the Government can now easily predict drought and can also find a solution to it and since now the supply chain is looked over by algorithms we have the perfect balance of demand and supply. Uff!! I talk a lot, I wish AGI could fix this too. Oops! I forgot to mention all of these miracles listed above are done by the greatest creation of mankind an AGI, man its name is too complicated let's just skip that. 
(Phone rings, call from the neighbor)
Shubh: Hello Sumit
Sumit: Hey Shubh!! I saw water running from your front door, I think you have left your tap running, your carpet must be all wet now, man you have to clean a lot.
Shubh: Holy shit!! Well, thank you for informing me.
(Shubh Hang ups now)
You see there, Sumit is such a stupid person he was worried about the carpet, not the water, well he isn't as stupid in 2050 as it would seem in 2022, that's because in 2050 we create water on our own yes you heard it right now I can't explain the process it's a lot of chemistry & physics for me, but AGI does it for us.
I still remember how Parth was so excited when his company announced that they have mastered the art of creating the most Aligned AGI, the news spread faster than that old virus spread out in the late 20s I think it's covid-19 whatever, the whole world was thrilled about this news and my friend Parth use to state it as the biggest Eucatastrophe in the entire history of mankind. While half of the world was willing to adopt it as fast as they could, some people were scared of AGI ruling the planet. I know that's funny, but I don't know why they thought this, maybe they were some kind of Hollywood freak or something. But regardless of all the old-school politics and slow governing system, AGI saw even faster adoption than cryptocurrencies.
It's such an irony that 20 years back things which seemed impossible are done daily, unsolvable problems are no more a problem.
Man!! I talk too much, well it's getting late I gotta go, bye!
